# Hello World Example

## Generator CLI

The Hello World Example features a generator that you can run via cli.

* Ensure the complete project was properly built, otherwise run `npm install` from the root of the Langium project.
* Run `npm install -g ./` from the hello-world directory.
* Use `hello-world-cli` to run the cli. Follow the instructions or use `hello-world-cli generate <full-path-to-hello-file>`.

The generator produces JavaScript code that prints "Hello, {name}!" for each Greeting.

## VSCode Extension
